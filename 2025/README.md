2025 — Advent of Code

This year's solutions are implemented in Go.

Quick start
-----------
- Ensure you have Go installed (Go 1.18+ recommended).
- To run a specific day's solution (if the day is a Go package), from the repo root:
	- `go run ./2025/01` — runs Day 1 if it has a main package
	- `go build ./2025/01 && ./01` — build and run Day 1

Notes
-----
- Each day's code is kept in its corresponding directory (e.g. `2025/01`).
- This is a personal repository; there may be experimental code and utilities alongside final solutions.

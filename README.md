# Advent of Code — Personal Solutions

Minimal, personal repository for Advent of Code solutions.

Each year's puzzles are stored in the `YYYY/` folder (e.g. `2025/`). Solutions are implemented per-day and can use different languages depending on the year.

Usage
-----
- Browse the year folder you want, then the day folder inside it.
- For 2025 I'm using Go (see `2025/README.md` for runnable instructions).

Contributing
------------
This is a personal workspace — feel free to browse, learn, and open suggestions via PR, but no formal contribution process is required.
